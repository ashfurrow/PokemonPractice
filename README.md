# Pokemon Practice

When interviewing Senior+ software developers, I've often seen them struggle when programming in fresh app environments. I get it â€“ we are so used to working day-to-day in codebases that have been set up and fine-tuned that it's hard to start from scratch. We are so used to design systems, custom abstractions, linter configurations, etc that it's paralyzing to suddenly work "without a net", so to speak.

I'm currently interviewing and I wanted to make sure I was comfortable working in a fresh project, so I started this one. Pretty soon, though, I started tweaking things the way _I_ like them. So this repository is both a way for me to practice building something from scratch and a way for me to add tooling/systems/abstractions thoughtfully, from first principles.

I'll [blog](https://ashfurrow.com) about this soon, and you can check out the [open issues](https://github.com/ashfurrow/PokemonPractice/issues) for an idea of where this is going next.
